# python-analyze

This repository will eventually contain source code to analyze short Python programs.

## Task 1
- Create a small repository (~1000 codes) of Python programs attempting student submissions.

Datasets like these should be helpful to get you started.

https://www.itshared.org/2015/12/codeforces-submissions-dataset-for.html

- Write a script such that for every program in your repository, you replace *every* existing function call with *foo()*.
For instance, if your program reads -
```
def count_list_repeats(li):
    x = 5
    verify_results(li, x)
    ...
```
it should automatically get converted to -
```
def count_list_repeats(li):
    x = 5
    foo(li, x)
    ...
```

- Hint: Do not be tempted to use a regular expression/grep like strategy to make these replacements. Look up what abstract syntax trees of programs are. Modify them to achieve this functionality.

- Have at least one plot, or one table which summarizes relevant statistics from the dataset. To begin with, for the task mentioned above, ask yourself what statistics you think are even relevant and would want answered?

## Instructions
- Fork this repo and work on a local copy. Make it a habit to push changes upstream to this repo as frequently as feasible.
- Use `Python3.7+` for this work.
- We workship the lords of reproducability of results. Use `conda` to create an environment and set up your repository. 
- Use a `.gitignore` file to ensure you are not adding junk files to the repo.
- Have a `./src/` folder containing the source.
- Have a `./data/` folder containing all the data your source accesses.
- Have a `./test/` folder to write out unit tests for key functions. Look up the `unittest` package in Python if you haven't used it before.
Just setting this up can be a little painful and time consuming. Wade through it.
- Keep updating this README with instructions which will help with the reproducability of your work/results.
